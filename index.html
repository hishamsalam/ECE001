<h3>introduction:</h3>
An operating system, in short, is a set of software responsible for managing resources (computer hardware) and computer software, and it represents an intermediary between the user, computer hardware, and by another definition the operating system represents a bridge to run user programs, and it performs basic tasks such as: managing and allocating computer resources (memory, disk Steel, access to peripherals etc ...), prioritizing order handling, controlling input and output devices such as: the keyboard, as well as to facilitate network handling, file management, modern multipurpose computers, are comprehensive for personal computers and supercomputers and have an operating system To run the rest of the programs, such as software applications. Examples of personal computer operating systems are Microsoft Windows, GNU / Linux, Mac OS and (Darwin), Mac OSX and Unix. The lowest level of any operating system is its core. This is the first layer of software that is loaded into memory when the system boots or starts up. The kernel provides access to other popular central services for all system software and applications. These services include (and not only): task scheduling, memory management, disk access, and hardware access. As is the case with the kernel, the operating system often provides system software for managing the graphical user interface (although Windows and Macintosh have integrated these programs into a system Employment). And also tools for tasks such as file management and operating system setup. Often, it distributes with the operating system software that is not directly related to the basic functions of the operating system, but whoever distributes the operating system finds benefit in distributing it with it. The separation between the operating system and application software is not clear, and it is often a matter of dispute. From a commercial or legal point of view, the separation depends on the context of the interests involved in the topic. For example, one of the main questions in the US vs. Microsoft issue is whether Microsoft's web browser is part of the operating system or not. As with the term "operating system", the dispute sometimes revolves around what the kernel should manage specifically, with The debate about whether or not something like the file system should be in the kernel. Some support a small kernel, some support a single kernel, and so on. Most operating systems are used on most computers, but not all. The simpler computers with smaller implanted systems and many early computers without an operating system, instead of operating systems, have relied on application programs to manage hardware with their knowledge, perhaps with the help of libraries designed for this purpose.
